# Save Evil Creatures
Evil creatures have been thought by many people to be evil, mainly due to their name. The truth could not be farther from this.  They are the most adorable creatures in all of Gielinor and this plugin allows them to be featured prominently as they should be. This plugin does so by replacing a large number of gnome models with the evil creature models.

Note: These evil creatures cannot be attacked as a result of the plugin, but why would you ever want to?
